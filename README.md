# Viridian-Trade-Bot-Manager
### A discord bot based RAT to manage the viridian trade bot.






once done, I recommend you to create a shortcut for restarter.py or restarter.exe and putting it in your windows start menu folder, what this does is every time your vps crashes the application can auto restart your bot, if you need help adding it to your start menu folder, go to the file manager, you will see a thing that looks kinda like this [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/48303729/180705783-b697efc8-60ca-4b6d-ba57-77db3089fa1a.png) click to the right of everything, and copy paste this in `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs` that will bring you to the start menu folder where you can drop the shortcut into.
